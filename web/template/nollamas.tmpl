                The page you're visiting is guarded from "ai" scrapers
                and other crawlers by a proof-of-work challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, this means that Javascript is required.
                To see the page, <b>please enable Javascript and try again</b>.
            </p>
            <aside>
                Once your browser has completed the challenge, you can turn
                Javascript off again if you like. Revalidation is done once per hour.
