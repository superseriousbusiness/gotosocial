		<h1>Suspended Instances</h1>

			The following list of domains have been suspended by the administrator(s) of this server.

		<p>
			All current and future accounts on these instances are blocked, and no more data is federated to the remote
			servers.
			This extends to subdomains, so an entry for 'example.com' includes 'social.example.com' as well.
