		<h1>404: Not Found</h1>
		<p>
			GoToSocial only serves Public statuses via the web.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you reached this page by clicking on a status link,
			it's likely that the status is not Public. You can try
			entering the status URL in your client's search bar,
			to view the status from your account. If that doesn't
			work, it's possible that the status has been deleted by
			the author, you don't have permission to view it, or it
			doesn't exist at all.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you believe this 404 was an error, you can contact
			the instance admin. Provide them with the following
			request ID: <code>{{- .requestID -}}</code>.
