			Domain permission excludes prevent permissions for a domain (and all
			subdomains) from being auomatically managed by domain permission subscriptions.
			<br/>
			For example, if you create an exclude entry for <code>example.org</code>, then
			a blocklist or allowlist subscription will <em>exclude</em> entries for <code>example.org</code>
			and any of its subdomains (<code>sub.example.org</code>, <code>another.sub.example.org</code> etc.)
			when creating domain permission drafts and domain blocks/allows.
			<br/>
			This functionality allows you to manually manage permissions for excluded domains,
			in cases where you know you definitely do or don't want to federate with a given domain,
			no matter what entries are contained in a domain permission subscription.
			<br/>
			Note that by itself, creation of an exclude entry for a given domain does not affect
			federation with that domain at all, it is only useful in combination with permission subscriptions.
