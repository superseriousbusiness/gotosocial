// Package propertytype contains the implementation for the type property. All
// applications are strongly encouraged to use the interface instead of this
// concrete definition. The interfaces allow applications to consume only the
// types and properties needed and be independent of the go-fed implementation
// if another alternative implementation is created. This package is
// code-generated and subject to the same license as the go-fed tool used to
// generate it.
//
// This package is independent of other types' and properties' implementations
// by having a Manager injected into it to act as a factory for the concrete
// implementations. The implementations have been generated into their own
// separate subpackages for each vocabulary.
//
// Strongly consider using the interfaces instead of this package.
