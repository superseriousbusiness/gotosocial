// NewTransport returns a new Transport on behalf of a specific actor.
//
// The actorBoxIRI will be either the inbox or outbox of an actor who is
// attempting to do the dereferencing or delivery. Any authentication
// scheme applied on the request must be based on this actor. The
// request must contain some sort of credential of the user, such as a
// HTTP Signature.
//
// The gofedAgent passed in should be used by the Transport
// implementation in the User-Agent, as well as the application-specific
// user agent string. The gofedAgent will indicate this library's use as
// well as the library's version number.
//
// Any server-wide rate-limiting that needs to occur should happen in a
// Transport implementation. This factory function allows this to be
// created, so peer servers are not DOS'd.
//
// Any retry logic should also be handled by the Transport
// implementation.
//
// Note that the library will not maintain a long-lived pointer to the
// returned Transport so that any private credentials are able to be
// garbage collected.
