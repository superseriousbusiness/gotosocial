# Third-Party Packaging

Several awesome people have put time and energy into packaging GoToSocial for third-party ecosystems. These projects are listed below:

- [YunoHost GoToSocial Packaging](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/gotosocial_ynh) by [OniriCorpe](https://github.com/OniriCorpe).
- [Unofficial Arch Linux Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gotosocial)

These packages are not maintained by GoToSocial, so please direct questions and issues to the repository maintainers (and donate to them!).
