# Database

GoToSocial stores statuses, accounts, etc, in a database. This can be either [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) or [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/).

By default, GoToSocial will use Postgres, but this is easy to change.

## SQLite

SQLite, as the name implies, is the lightest database type that GoToSocial can use. It stores entries in a simple file format, usually in the same directory as the GoToSocial binary itself. SQLite is great for small instances and single-board computers, where a dedicated database would be overkill.

To configure GoToSocial to use SQLite, change `db-type` to `sqlite`. The `address` setting will then be a filename instead of an address, so you will want to change it to `sqlite.db` or something similar.

Note that the `:memory:` setting will use an *in-memory database* which will be wiped when your GoToSocial instance stops running. This is for testing only and is absolutely not suitable for running a proper instance, so *don't do this*.

## Postgres

Postgres is a heavier database format, which is useful for larger instances where you need to scale performance, or where you need to run your database on a dedicated machine separate from your GoToSocial instance (or do funky stuff like run a database cluster).

You can connect to Postgres using either a Unix socket connection, or via TCP, depending on what you've set as your `db-address` value.

GoToSocial also supports connecting to Postgres using SSL/TLS over TCP. If you're running Postgres on a different machine from GoToSocial, and connecting to it via an IP address or hostname (as opposed to just running on localhost), then SSL/TLS is **CRUCIAL** to avoid leaking data all over the place!

When you're using Postgres, GoToSocial expects whatever you've set for `db-user` to already be created in the database, and to have ownership of whatever you've set for `db-database`.

For example, if you set:

```text
db:
  [...]
  user: "gotosocial"
  password: "some_really_good_password"
  database: "gotosocial"  
```

Then you should have already created database `gotosocial` in Postgres, and given ownership of it to the `gotosocial` user.

The psql commands to do this will look something like:

```psql
create database gotosocial with locale 'C.UTF-8' template template0;
create user gotosocial with password 'some_really_good_password';
grant all privileges on database gotosocial to gotosocial;
```

If you start using Postgres after 14, or you encounter `error executing command: error creating dbservice: db migration error: ERROR: permission denied for schema public`, you should grant `CREATE` permission to your db user *(This **must** be run in a postgres shell that's connected to the gotosocial database)*:

```psql
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO gotosocial;
SELECT has_schema_privilege('gotosocial', 'public', 'CREATE'); -- should return t
```

GoToSocial makes use of ULIDs (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers) which will not work in non-English collate environments. For this reason it is important to create the database with `C.UTF-8` locale. To do that on systems which were already initialized with non-C locale, `template0` pristine database template must be used.

If you want to use specific options when connecting to Postgres, you can use `db-postgres-connection-string` to define the connection string. If `db-postgres-connection-string` is defined, all other database related configuration fields will be ignored. For example, we can use `db-postgres-connection-string` to connect to `mySchema`, where the user name is `myUser` and password is `myPass` at `localhost` with the database name of `db`:

```yaml
db-postgres-connection-string: 'postgres://myUser:myPass@localhost/db?search_path=mySchema'
```

## Settings

!!! danger "SQLite cache sizes"
    More is not necessarily better for caches. They need to be tuned to the workload. The defaults should be plenty for most instances and you shouldn't change it. If you do change it, ensure you mention this when requesting help in the GoToSocial Help channel.

```yaml
############################
##### DATABASE CONFIG ######
############################

# Config pertaining to the Gotosocial database connection

# String. Database type.
# Options: ["postgres","sqlite"]
# Default: "postgres"
db-type: "postgres"

# String. Database address or parameters.
#
# For Postgres, this should be the address or socket at which the database can be reached.
#
# For Sqlite, this should be the path to your sqlite database file. Eg., /opt/gotosocial/sqlite.db.
# If the file doesn't exist at the specified path, it will be created.
# If just a filename is provided (no directory) then the database will be created in the same directory
# as the GoToSocial binary.
# If address is set to :memory: then an in-memory database will be used (no file).
# WARNING: :memory: should NOT BE USED except for testing purposes.
#
# Examples: ["localhost","my.db.host","127.0.0.1","192.111.39.110",":memory:", "sqlite.db"]
# Default: ""
db-address: ""

# Int. Port for database connection.
# Examples: [5432, 1234, 6969]
# Default: 5432
db-port: 5432

# String. Username for the database connection.
# Examples: ["mydbuser","postgres","gotosocial"]
# Default: ""
db-user: ""

# String. Password to use for the database connection
# Examples: ["password123","verysafepassword","postgres"]
# Default: ""
db-password: ""

# String. Name of the database to use within the provided database type.
# Examples: ["mydb","postgres","gotosocial"]
# Default: "gotosocial"
db-database: "gotosocial"

# String. Disable, enable, or require SSL/TLS connection to the database.
# If "disable" then no TLS connection will be attempted.
# If "enable" then TLS will be tried, but the database certificate won't be checked (for self-signed certs).
# If "require" then TLS will be required to make a connection, and a valid certificate must be presented.
# Options: ["disable", "enable", "require"]
# Default: "disable"
db-tls-mode: "disable"

# String. Path to a CA certificate on the host machine for db certificate validation.
# If this is left empty, just the host certificates will be used.
# If filled in, the certificate will be loaded and added to host certificates.
# Examples: ["/path/to/some/cert.crt"]
# Default: ""
db-tls-ca-cert: ""

# Int. Number to multiply by CPU count to set permitted total of open database connections (in-use and idle).
# You can use this setting to tune your database connection behavior, though most admins won't need to touch it.
#
# Example values for multiplier 8:
#
# 1 cpu = 08 open connections
# 2 cpu = 16 open connections
# 4 cpu = 32 open connections
#
# Example values for multiplier 4:
#
# 1 cpu = 04 open connections
# 2 cpu = 08 open connections
# 4 cpu = 16 open connections
#
# A multiplier of 8 is a sensible default, but you may wish to increase this for instances
# running on very performant hardware, or decrease it for instances using v. slow CPUs.
#
# If you set the multiplier to less than 1, only one open connection will be used regardless of cpu count.
#
# PLEASE NOTE!!: This setting currently only applies for Postgres. SQLite will always use 1 connection regardless
# of what is set here. This behavior will change in future when we implement better SQLITE_BUSY handling.
# See https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues/1407 for more details.
#
# Examples: [16, 8, 10, 2]
# Default: 8
db-max-open-conns-multiplier: 8

# String. SQLite journaling mode.
# SQLite only -- unused otherwise.
# If set to empty string, the sqlite default will be used.
# See: https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode
# Examples: ["DELETE", "TRUNCATE", "PERSIST", "MEMORY", "WAL", "OFF"]
# Default: "WAL"
db-sqlite-journal-mode: "WAL"

# String. SQLite synchronous mode.
# SQLite only -- unused otherwise.
# If set to empty string, the sqlite default will be used.
# See: https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous
# Examples: ["OFF", "NORMAL", "FULL", "EXTRA"]
# Default: "NORMAL"
db-sqlite-synchronous: "NORMAL"

# Byte size. SQlite cache size.
# SQLite only -- unused otherwise.
# If set to empty string or zero, the sqlite default (2MiB) will be used.
# See: https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_cache_size
#
# More is not necessarily better for caches. They need to be tuned to the
# workload. The defaults should be plenty for most instances and you shouldn't
# change it. If you do change it, ensure you mention this when requesting help
# in the GoToSocial Help channel.
#
# Examples: ["0", "2MiB", "8MiB", "64MiB"]
# Default: "8MiB"
db-sqlite-cache-size: "8MiB"

# Duration. SQlite busy timeout.
# SQLite only -- unused otherwise.
# If set to empty string or zero, the sqlite default will be used.
# See: https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_busy_timeout
# Examples: ["0s", "1s", "30s", "1m", "5m"]
# Default: "30m"
db-sqlite-busy-timeout: "30m"

# String. Full Database connection string
#
# This connection string is only applicable for Postgres. When this field is defined, all other database related configuration field will be ignored. This field allow you to fine tune connection with Postgres
# 
# Examples: ["postgres://user:pass@localhost/db?search_path=gotosocial", "postgres://user:pass@localhost:9999/db"]
# Default: ""
db-postgres-connection-string: ""

cache:
  # cache.memory-target sets a target limit that
  # the application will try to keep it's caches
  # within. This is based on estimated sizes of
  # in-memory objects, and so NOT AT ALL EXACT.
  # Examples: ["100MiB", "200MiB", "500MiB", "1GiB"]
  # Default: "100MiB"
  memory-target: "100MiB"
