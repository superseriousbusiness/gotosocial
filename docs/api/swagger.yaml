            If whole_word is true, client app should do:
            Define ‘word constituent character’ for your app. In the official implementation, it’s [A-Za-z0-9_] in JavaScript, and [[:word:]] in Ruby.
            Ruby uses the POSIX character class (Letter | Mark | Decimal_Number | Connector_Punctuation).
            If the phrase starts with a word character, and if the previous character before matched range is a word character, its matched range should be treated to not match.
            If the phrase ends with a word character, and if the next character after matched range is a word character, its matched range should be treated to not match.

                    `domain:[domain]` -- show emojis from the given domain, eg `?filter=domain:example.org` will show emojis from `example.org` only.
                    Instead of giving a specific domain, you can also give either one of the key words `local` or `all` to show either local emojis only (`domain:local`) or show all emojis from all domains (`domain:all`).
                    Note: `domain:*` is equivalent to `domain:all` (including local).
                    If no domain filter is provided, `domain:all` will be assumed.

                    `disabled` -- include emojis that have been disabled.

                    `enabled` -- include emojis that are enabled.

                    `shortcode:[shortcode]` -- show only emojis with the given shortcode, eg `?filter=shortcode:blob_cat_uwu` will show only emojis with the shortcode `blob_cat_uwu` (case sensitive).

                    If neither `disabled` or `enabled` are provided, both disabled and enabled emojis will be shown.

                    If no filter query string is provided, the default `domain:all` will be used, which will show all emojis from all domains.

                Action performed depends upon the action `type` provided.

                `disable`: disable a REMOTE emoji from being used/displayed on this instance. Does not work for local emojis.

                `copy`: copy a REMOTE emoji to this instance. When doing this action, a shortcode MUST be provided, and it must
                be unique among emojis already present on this instance. A category MAY be provided, and the copied emoji will then
                be put into the provided category.

                `modify`: modify a LOCAL emoji. You can provide a new image for the emoji and/or update the category.

                Local emojis cannot be deleted using this endpoint. To delete a local emoji, check DELETE /api/v1/admin/custom_emojis/{id} instead.

                This is useful in cases where the remote domain has had to rotate their keys for whatever
                reason (security issue, data leak, routine safety procedure, etc), and your instance can no
                longer communicate with theirs properly using cached keys. A key marked as expired in this way
                will be lazily refetched next time a request is made to your instance signed by the owner of that
                key, so no further action should be required in order to reestablish communication with that domain.

                This endpoint is explicitly not for rotating your *own* keys, it only works for remote instances.

                Using this endpoint to expire keys for a domain that hasn't rotated all of their keys is not
                harmful and won't break federation, but it is pointless and will cause unnecessary requests to
                be performed.

                        If a filter parameter is provided, then an array of objects with at least a `domain` key set on each object will be returned.

                        Domains that are silenced or suspended will also have a key `suspended_at` or `silenced_at` that contains an iso8601 date string. If one of these keys is not present on the domain object, it is open. Suspended instances may in some cases be obfuscated, which means they will have some letters replaced by `*` to make it more difficult for bad actors to target instances with harassment.

                        Whether a flat response or a more detailed response is returned, domains will be sorted alphabetically by hostname.

                If submitting using form data, use the following pattern:

                `VISIBILITY[INTERACTION_TYPE][CONDITION][INDEX]=Value`

                For example: `public[can_reply][always][0]=author`

                Using `curl` this might look something like:

                `curl -F 'public[can_reply][always][0]=author' -F 'public[can_reply][always][1]=followers'`

                The JSON equivalent would be:

                `curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"public":{"can_reply":{"always":["author","followers"]}}}'`

                Any visibility level left unspecified in the request body will be returned to the default.

                Ie., in the example above, "public" would be updated, but "unlisted", "private", and "direct" would be reset to defaults.

                The server will perform some normalization on submitted policies so that you can't submit totally invalid policies.

                The parameters can also be given in the body of the request, as JSON, if the content-type is set to 'application/json'.

                The 'interaction_policy' field can be used to set an interaction policy for this status.

                If submitting using form data, use the following pattern to set an interaction policy:

                `interaction_policy[INTERACTION_TYPE][CONDITION][INDEX]=Value`

                For example: `interaction_policy[can_reply][always][0]=author`

                Using `curl` this might look something like:

                `curl -F 'interaction_policy[can_reply][always][0]=author' -F 'interaction_policy[can_reply][always][1]=followers' [... other form fields ...]`

                The JSON equivalent would be:

                `curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"interaction_policy":{"can_reply":{"always":["author","followers"]}} [... other json fields ...]}'`

                The server will perform some normalization on the submitted policy so that you can't submit something totally invalid.
