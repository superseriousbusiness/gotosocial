                    `domain:[domain]` -- show emojis from the given domain, eg `?filter=domain:example.org` will show emojis from `example.org` only.
                    Instead of giving a specific domain, you can also give either one of the key words `local` or `all` to show either local emojis only (`domain:local`) or show all emojis from all domains (`domain:all`).
                    Note: `domain:*` is equivalent to `domain:all` (including local).
                    If no domain filter is provided, `domain:all` will be assumed.

                    `disabled` -- include emojis that have been disabled.

                    `enabled` -- include emojis that are enabled.

                    `shortcode:[shortcode]` -- show only emojis with the given shortcode, eg `?filter=shortcode:blob_cat_uwu` will show only emojis with the shortcode `blob_cat_uwu` (case sensitive).

                    If neither `disabled` or `enabled` are provided, both disabled and enabled emojis will be shown.

                    If no filter query string is provided, the default `domain:all` will be used, which will show all emojis from all domains.

                Action performed depends upon the action `type` provided.

                `disable`: disable a REMOTE emoji from being used/displayed on this instance. Does not work for local emojis.

                `copy`: copy a REMOTE emoji to this instance. When doing this action, a shortcode MUST be provided, and it must
                be unique among emojis already present on this instance. A category MAY be provided, and the copied emoji will then
                be put into the provided category.

                `modify`: modify a LOCAL emoji. You can provide a new image for the emoji and/or update the category.

                Local emojis cannot be deleted using this endpoint. To delete a local emoji, check DELETE /api/v1/admin/custom_emojis/{id} instead.

                      - `suspended` -- include peers that have been suspended.

                    If filter is `open`, only instances that haven't been suspended or silenced will be returned.

                    If filter is `suspended`, only suspended instances will be shown.

                    If filter is `open,suspended`, then all known instances will be returned.

                    If filter is an empty string or not set, then `open` will be assumed as the default.

                        If no filter parameter is provided, or filter is empty, then a legacy, Mastodon-API compatible response will be returned. This will consist of just a 'flat' array of strings like `["example.com", "example.org"]`, which corresponds to domains this instance peers with.

                        If a filter parameter is provided, then an array of objects with at least a `domain` key set on each object will be returned.

                        Domains that are silenced or suspended will also have a key `suspended_at` or `silenced_at` that contains an iso8601 date string. If one of these keys is not present on the domain object, it is open. Suspended instances may in some cases be obfuscated, which means they will have some letters replaced by `*` to make it more difficult for bad actors to target instances with harassment.

                        Whether a flat response or a more detailed response is returned, domains will be sorted alphabetically by hostname.

                                    If present, it should be parsed as a string.

                                    If `event` = `update`, then the payload will be a JSON string of a status.

                                    If `event` = `delete`, then the payload will be a status ID.
