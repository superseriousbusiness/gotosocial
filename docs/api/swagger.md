# API Documentation

GoToSocial uses [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) to generate a V2 [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/) document from code annotations.

The resulting API documentation is rendered below, for quick reference.

If you'd like to do more with the spec, you can also view the [swagger.yaml](/api/swagger/swagger.yaml) directly, and then paste it into something like the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) in order to autogenerate GoToSocial API clients in different languages, convert the doc to JSON or OpenAPI v3 specification, etc. See [here](https://swagger.io/tools/open-source/getting-started/) for more.
