# Advanced

In this section we touch on a number of more advanced topics, primarily related around building, deploying, operating and tuning GoToSocial.

We consider these topics advanced because applying them incorrectly does have the possibility of causing client and federation issues. Applying any of these configuration changes may also make it harder for you to debug an issue with your GoToSocial instance if you don't understand the changes that you're making.
