##### GENERAL CONFIG ######
###########################

# String. Log level to use throughout the application. Must be lower-case.
# Options: ["trace","debug","info","warn","error","fatal"]
# Default: "info"
logLevel: "info"

# String. Application name to use internally.
# Examples: ["My Application","gotosocial"]
# Default: "gotosocial"
applicationName: "gotosocial"

# String. Hostname that this server will be reachable at. Defaults to localhost for local testing,
# but you should *definitely* change this when running for real, or your server won't work at all.
# DO NOT change this after your server has already run once, or you will break things!
# Examples: ["gts.example.org","some.server.com"]
# Default: "localhost"
host: "localhost"

# String. Domain to use when federating profiles. This is useful when you want your server to be at
# eg., "gts.example.org", but you want the domain on accounts to be "example.org" because it looks better
# or is just shorter/easier to remember.
# To make this setting work properly, you need to redirect requests at "example.org/.well-known/webfinger"
# to "gts.example.org/.well-known/webfinger" so that GtS can handle them properly.
# You should also redirect requests at "example.org/.well-known/nodeinfo" in the same way.
# An empty string (ie., not set) means that the same value as 'host' will be used.
# DO NOT change this after your server has already run once, or you will break things!
# Examples: ["example.org","server.com"]
# Default: ""
accountDomain: ""

# String. Protocol to use for the server. Only change to http for local testing!
# This should be the protocol part of the URI that your server is actually reachable on. So even if you're
# running GoToSocial behind a reverse proxy that handles SSL certificates for you, instead of using built-in
# letsencrypt, it should still be https.
# Options: ["http","https"]
# Default: "https"
protocol: "https"

# Int. Listen port for the GoToSocial webserver + API. If you're running behind a reverse proxy and/or in a docker,
# container, just set this to whatever you like (or leave the default), and make sure it's forwarded properly.
# If you are running with built-in letsencrypt enabled, and running GoToSocial directly on a host machine, you will
# probably want to set this to 443 (standard https port), unless you have other services already using that port.
# This *MUST NOT* be the same as the letsencrypt port specified below, unless letsencrypt is turned off.
# Examples: [443, 6666, 8080]
# Default: 8080
port: 8080

# Array of string. CIDRs or IP addresses of proxies that should be trusted when determining real client IP from behind a reverse proxy.
# If you're running inside a Docker container behind Traefik or Nginx, for example, add the subnet of your docker network,
# or the gateway of the docker network, and/or the address of the reverse proxy (if it's not running on the host network).
# Example: ["127.0.0.1/32", "172.20.0.1"]
# Default: ["127.0.0.1/32"] (localhost)
trustedProxies:
  - "127.0.0.1/32"

  # Options: ["disable", "enable", "require"]
  # Default: "disable"
  tlsMode: "disable"

  # String. Path to a CA certificate on the host machine for db certificate validation.
  # If this is left empty, just the host certificates will be used.

  # If you're using local storage, this should be THE SAME as the value you've set for Host, above.

  # other than the one your instance is running on.
  # Examples: ["localhost", "example.org"]

  # Examples: [80, 8000, 1312]
  # Default: 80
  port: 80

  # String. Directory in which to store LetsEncrypt certificates.
  # It is a good move to make this a sub-path within your storage directory, as it makes
  # backup easier, but you might wish to move them elsewhere if they're also accessed by other services.
  # In any case, make sure GoToSocial has permissions to write to / read from this directory.
  # Examples: ["/home/gotosocial/storage/certs", "/acmecerts"]

  # never ever in a production environment as it's extremely unsafe!
  # Options: [true, false]
  # Default: false
  skipVerification: false

  # String. The OIDC issuer URI. This is where GtS will redirect users to for login.
  # Typically this will look like a standard web URL.

  issuer: ""

  # String. The ID for this client as registered with the OIDC provider.
  # Examples: ["some-client-id", "fda3772a-ad35-41c9-9a59-f1943ad18f54"]

  # populate users created in GtS as a result of the authentication flow. 'openid' and 'email' are required.
  # 'profile' is used to extract a username for the newly created user.
  # 'groups' is optional and can be used to determine if a user is an admin (if they're in the group 'admin' or 'admins').
